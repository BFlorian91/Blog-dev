## QuickTips Flutter:

On many applications, there is a sort of loading page when they are launched. This is what we call a splash screen and we will see here how to do this thing in the simplest way possible.

### -1 Create the root

  Yes, because in fact, make a page that displays a logo or a load for ***X*** seconds, you have to redirect somewhere after, and thatâ€™s when the router comes into action.

  ```js
  // main.dart
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        home: SplashScreen(),
        routes: {
          '/home-screen': (context) => HomeScreen(),
        },
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### -2 Create the splashScreen

  ```js
  // SplashScreen.dart
  class SplashScreen extends StatefulWidget {
    @override
    _SplashScreenState createState() => _SplashScreenState();
  }

  class _SplashScreenState extends State<SplashScreen> {
    @override
    void initState() {
      super.initState();
      Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
        () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/home-screen'),
      );
    }

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.white,
        body: Center(
          child: FlutterLogo(
            size: 100.0,
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
```

### **Time to explain:**

#### <span style="color: #0276E8">-1 Future</span>

A Future is used to represent a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future. 
Receivers of a Future can register callbacks that handle the value or error once it is available.

#### <span style="color: #0276E8">-2 Future<span style="color: #BC0256">.delayed</span></span>
The computation will be executed after the given **Duration** has passed, and the future is completed with the result of the computation.
