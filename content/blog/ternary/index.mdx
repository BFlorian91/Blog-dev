The ternary, the best way to understand it, it's an example:

##### - If statement

```js
// if mode
  const String test = 'Hello'
  const String test1 = 'HellO'

  if (test == test1) {
    print('The words are the same');
  }
  print('The words are different');
```

##### - Ternary:

```js
// ternary mode
  const String test = 'Hello'
  const String test1 = 'HellO'

  print(test == test1 ? 'The words are the same' : 'The word are different');
```

The both examples do the same thing, but the first take 4 lines, and the second does only 1 line.
The ternary operator is a condition plus true or false blocks all in one, split up by a <span style="color:purple">***?***</span> and a <span style="color:purple">***:***</span>.

So, <span style="color:purple">***?***</span> is equal to an **if**, and the <span style="color:purple">***:***</span> is equal to an **else**.
